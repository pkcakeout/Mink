# Mink

Project mink is a collection of scripts that can be used for a
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) managed cluster computing algorithms. The 
scripts in the worker directory are to be installed on the client computers 
and executed so that they can communicate with a central queue manager 
that controls the client from that point onwards.
